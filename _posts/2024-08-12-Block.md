In this challenge, we have been given on zip file named evidence.zip. We have to extract it and look into the files to answer the questions. This challenge was more of a blue team kind of challenge imo. Let's start the challenge.

After unzipping the zip file we get two files: `lsass.DMP` and `traffic.pcapng`.
## What is the username of the first person who accessed our server?
We will use tool called `pypykatz` to analyze `lsass.DMP` file. Rune the following command to get minidump from our dmp file:
```console
$ pypykatz lsa minidump lsass.DMP
```

Analyse the output to get username as **`mrealman`**

## What is the password of the user in question 1?

In the same output, we can get user's NTHash: `1f9175a516211660c7a8143b0f36ab44`
We can use crackstation to crack the hash and get password: **`Blockbuster1`**

We will skip question 3 for now.

## What is the username of the second person who accessed our server?

After scrolling a bit in the same output, we can get our second user as answer: **`eshellstrop`**

## What is the hash of the user in question 4?

We can get NT hash for the user the from the same output. I tried to crack this hash from crackstation but was not able to do it, but we only require hash as our answer: **`3f29138a04aadc19214e9c04028bf381`**

## What is the flag that the first user got access to?

Back to question 3, it was tricky to find the answer for this.
I load traffic.pcapng file in wireshark and found NTLMSSP authentication being used. So we have to decrypt the data to get results.
After some research, I found this blog to move forward: [Blog](https://wiki.wireshark.org/NTLMSSP#:~:text=The%20%22NT%20Password%22%20setting%20can,simple%20method%20for%20Unicode%20encoding).

According to this blog we have to add our password in `Edit -> Preferences -> Protocols -> NTLMSSP -> NT Password` in wireshark. After this I found file named `clients156.csv`:
![CSV File 1](/assets/images/TryHackMe-Block/csv_file_1.png)

Now, we will export this file from `File -> Export Objects -> SMB`. Look into the exported file to get the flag:

## What is the flag that the second user got access to?

For this flag, we do not have password for the second user like first user and I was not able to crack it either. I found this blog that suggests how to use NT hash to decrypt data in wireshark: [Blog](https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/decrypt-encrypted-stub-data-in-wireshark-deb132c076e7)

According to the blog we need to create one keytab file and load it in wireshark to decrypt traffic data. First we need [keytab.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/forest-trust-tools/blob/master/keytab.py) and edit it to use 23(RC4) as key type for NT hash.

![Keytab file](/assets/images/TryHackMe-Block/keytab_file.png)

Save this file and run it to get keytab file:
```console
$ python3 keytab.py keytab.kt 
```
Now, go to `Edit -> Preferences -> KRB5` and load `keytab.kt` file. We can notice one more .csv file called `clients978.csv`.

Now, export this file and read it to get the flag:
